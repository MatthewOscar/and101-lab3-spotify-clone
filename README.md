# AND101 Lab 3 - Spotify Login Screen UI

Submitted by: **Matthew Wyatt**

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Spotify Clone** is an android app that allows the user to enter a username and password. The app will also display a button that the user could tap after entering their information. The colors and drawables represent the branding of the Spotify app.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ“±ðŸŽµðŸŸ¢**
